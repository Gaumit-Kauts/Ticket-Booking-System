# Ticket-Booking-System
Design and Built a movie ticket booking system in java
Started with the plan-driven approach by designing the Class-Relationip diagram, Attribute diagrams and UML diagrams.
Explored software design patterns that would go smoothly with the project and implied Singleton Design Pattern
Used SQL for the databse and JDBC for initiating the connection
Came up with a working movie ticket booking system which can allow the end-users to book/cancel the tickets and on the other hand allows the developers to add/delete/modify the movie tickets and cinemas.
